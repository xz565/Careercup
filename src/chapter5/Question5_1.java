 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j  
 * Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M 
 * (eg, M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)   
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
 * Output: N = 10001010100
